    <p>Digital technologies permeate our culture today, leaving virtually no area of meaning-making untouched. Vast social media platforms struggle to cope with the political consequences of their own scale, economics increasingly acknowledges a new type of capital in digital data, and artificial intelligence has gained an infrastructural role in our societies through the help of planetary-scale computing.</p>
    <p>The Digital Theory Lab seeks to develop and maintain the broad-based, interdisciplinary conceptual framework necessary for understanding and transforming the way we live in and with the digital.</p>
    <p>Employing a workshop-based, collaborative learning approach to the
    history and theory of the digital, the Lab fosters projects and writing
    that contribute to a theoretical framework for understanding the nature of
    the digital. We have a particular focus on machine learning and the new AI,
    including neural nets and large language models. Some results have been
    published in <a
        href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/717320?journalCode=ci">Critical
        Inquiry</a>, and the Lab maintains a regular local meeting schedule as
    well as a talk and works-in-progress series in hybrid format with our
    international affiliates.</p>
